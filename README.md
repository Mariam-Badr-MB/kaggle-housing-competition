# **🏡 Housing Prices Prediction – Kaggle Competition**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project is a solution for the **Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users**. The goal is to develop a **machine learning model** to predict housing prices based on various features like lot size, number of rooms, and location.  

## **📊 Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes housing data with multiple features that influence house prices.  

- **Training Data:** `train.csv`  
- **Test Data:** `test.csv`  
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (House Price)  

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** 📊  
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖  
- **Random Forest Regressor** 🌲  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓  

## **🚀 Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical features  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Selected relevant features  
   - Scaled and transformed data  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Used **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - Evaluated performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  

4. **Predictions & Submission**  
   - Generated predictions for test data  
   - Saved results in Kaggle’s submission format  

## **📈 Results & Future Improvements**  
✅ Achieved a solid baseline model for house price prediction.  
🔹 Possible enhancements: Feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced models like **XGBoost**.
